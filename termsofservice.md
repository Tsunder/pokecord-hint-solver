## Terms of Service

Pokehintzz is a free (as in $0) bot that provides no guarentee that it works.

Its source code is available on github: https://github.com/Tsunder/pokecord-hint-solver

## Privacy Policy

Pokehintzz will store minimal data as needed to save settings on a per-server basis. These settings and server information are deleted once the bot is no longer in the server.

The bot requires message reading permissions on a server to function. It reads messages in channels it can sees in order to respond to them (i.e., change settings, execute a command/guess a hint, or respond to a hint message). The message content is not saved.
